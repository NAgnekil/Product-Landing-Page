# Case study
The goal of the EcoWave (fictive company) project was to design a product landing page that highlights the company's commitment to sustainability through its eco-friendly outdoor gear. The objective was to create a clean, modern, and user-centric interface that showcases the brand's products and mission.

The certification focuses on HTML and CSS and therefore I built the product using these, with an emphasis on responsive design and clean UI. The design aimed to reflect the brandâ€™s values while providing intuitive navigation. I have worked a lot with card design and animations in this project.

The resulting website successfully promotes EcoWave's eco-friendly mission, featuring product sections and customer testimonials, all while delivering a seamless and appealing user experience. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web solutions while keeping the user and brand identity in focus.
